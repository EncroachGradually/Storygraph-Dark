Storygraph hurt my eyes so made a dark theme use something like [stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) then go onto storygraph, click the addon>write new style for this site>paste in
I'm lazy and this project should be considered abandoned for the time being 

**todo:**
* [ ] Make stats page not look awful
* [X] Fix dropdown boxes
* [ ] Filter list pane
* [ ] Sort out top banner
* [ ] Fix progress bar
